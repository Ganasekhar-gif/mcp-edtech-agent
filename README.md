# 🧠 Sunbird Ed AI Assistant (MCP Protocol Integration)

This project is a prototype AI assistant integrated with the **Sunbird Ed** learning platform using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** concepts. The goal is to enable contextual, conversational support for learners and admins, powered by **LLaMA 3** (via Ollama) and mock Sunbird APIs.

> ✅ Successfully demonstrates API tooling, agent reasoning, and installation-level context using mocked data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Sunbird Ed is a modular Digital Public Good (DPG) that supports personalized learning and skilling at scale. This project introduces an **AI assistant** that can:

- Answer user queries about course metadata, enrollments, and progress.
- Simulate Sunbird Ed behavior using mock API responses.
- Provide intelligent responses using an LLM (LLaMA 3) + tool calling logic.
- Lay the foundation for personalized learning support using MCP.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Model**: [LLaMA 3 (via Ollama)](https://ollama.com/library/llama3)
- **MCP SDK**: *Conceptually implemented* with tool schemas (No official Python MCP Agent SDK used yet)
- **API Simulation**: Local mock APIs (FastAPI or static mocks)
- **Env Management**: `dotenv`
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line agent interface

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Set Environment Variables Create a .env file:
   
PYTHONPATH=D:/sunbird-ai-assistant  # working directory change accordingly
MCP_MODEL=llama3
MCP_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
MCP_API_KEY=null

3. Run the Assistant
python cli/main.py

Note: PYTHONPATH is automatically loaded and appended to sys.path during runtime.

 Current Features
 Course listing via course/v1/search (mocked)
 Enrollment data via user/enrollment/list (mocked)
 User profile and progress via user/v1/profile (mocked)
 CLI test loop for simulating contextual queries
 Model reasoning using LLaMA 3 with tool calling

  Future Improvements
🔄 Replace mocks with real Sunbird API integration
🎯 Extend support to user-level personalization
🧠 Use official Python MCP Agent SDK (if needed)
🌐 Add web-based interface (Phase 2)

Requesting API Access
We are currently using mock APIs. Access to real APIs (e.g., course/v1/search, user/v1/profile, user/enrollment/list) is requested for full integration and validation with Sunbird Ed.
